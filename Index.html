           <h2 class="mission-title">The Problem</h2>
           <p class="mission-content">If you're experiecing depression, anxiety, or a similar mental illness, chances are someone in your family is too.
        Many mental health illnesses are heriditary and often times go unnoticed and undisgnosed because of lack of resources, which 
        in turn creates lack of knowledge.
        This lack of knowledge being passed down through generations sometimes creates a chain of tolerance and other-ing of those 
        struggling with mental illnesses within familial units.

           <h2 class="mission-title">Our Mission</h2>
           <p class="mission-content">GenHealth recognizes that undiagnosed intergenerational mental health is detremental not only to individiuals 
        but also families. We provide those dealing with hereditary mental health illnesses the resources they need to diagnose

        <h2 class="process-title">The Process</h2>
        <p class="process-content">Before recieving any of the services provided through us, participants must first go through a pre-screening process.
        This includes a questionaire or submission of family history form from your personal physician in addition to an interview with 
        a medical professional. The pre-screening can take place virtually or at one of our participating locations. If qualified, 
        you will receive an email of the recommended services determined by your interviewer and a form to sign up for one or more. 
        After this is completed, one of our agents will contact you to set up appointments at one of our participating doctors offices 
        nearest you.
