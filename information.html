           <p class="mission-content">If you're experiencing depression, anxiety, or a similar mental illness, there's a 20%-60% chance that someone in your family is too.
        Many mental health illnesses are heriditary and often times go unnoticed and undiagnosed because of lack of resources, which 
        in turn creates lack of knowledge.
        When passed down through generations, this lack of knowledge sometimes creates a chain of tolerance and other-ing of those 
        struggling with mental illnesses within familial units.
